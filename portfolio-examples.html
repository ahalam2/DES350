<h1>Site 1</h1>	
	<h3><a href="https://revolvestudio.co/about">https://revolvestudio.co/about</a></h3>
<h3>The reason I like this website is because of the color scheme. The black and white is simple yet effective. <br>
It has enough going on to keep your attention, but not too much that it's overwhelming to the eye.</h3>
	
	<h1>Site 2</h1>
	<h3><a href="https://qodeinteractive.com/catalog/">https://qodeinteractive.com/catalog/</a></h3>
<h3>The reason I like this site is because of how interactive it is. It shows a lot of different colors and <br>
	all of the projects are shown in a unique way.</h3>
